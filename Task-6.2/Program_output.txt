This is a given text without the garbage:
This is an example text given in the function… "Execution"


This is a text from the file ../../../Source.txt
The    text    file    contains    a text,   between    the    words
there    can    be    any    number    of   spaces.    Punctuation
marks    are used  correctly    and    are    tied    to    words.    Create
    a    class    for working    with    text    that    can    read    information
from    the    stream    and    print    the    information    as    well    as    have  methods    for    editing    and    data processing.    Split
the   text    to   sentences  and    print    each    sentence    from    the    paragraph  to    the    file    "Result.txt",    which
has surely  to  be    added    to    the    repository.    Assume    that    a
sentence  may    be...    in    several    lines.
Print    on    the    screen the    longest    and    shortest    words
of every    sentence.
